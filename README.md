Hello Everyone!

I will be creating video walkthroughs for various [TryHackMe.com](tryhackme.com) rooms, predominately from the Cyber Defense learning path.

You can check out my YouTube, [CyberSec Jake](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChS99q3p0uREQ8r_6-RDIbw) and see if there are any videos there that may help you.

Hope to see you there!

Jake
